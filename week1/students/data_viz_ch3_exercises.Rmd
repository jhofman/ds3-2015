# color declaration should be outside of aesthetic but inside geom_point


# 3.3.1 E2
```{r}
mpg
```
# Categorical: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
# Continuous: displ, year, cyl, cty, hwy

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +

# Color can take continuous or categorical data
# Size only takes continuous
# Shape only takes categorical

```{r}

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
